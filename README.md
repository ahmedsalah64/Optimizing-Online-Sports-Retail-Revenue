# Optimizing-Online-Sports-Retail-Revenue

Sports clothing is a booming sector!

In this notebook, I will use my SQL skills to analyze product data for an online sports retail company.

I will work with numeric, string, and timestamp data on pricing and revenue, ratings, reviews, descriptions, and website traffic.

I will use techniques such as aggregation, cleaning, labeling, Common Table Expressions, and correlation to produce recommendations on how the company can maximize revenue!
